* G3 - Triple Geek Library
* Everyone has a collection of utils and stuff. This is mine. Mainly focussed around 
* SVG creation and animation and supporting stuff like vector bits without relying on jQuery SVG
*
* No version number and no tests, I'm a bad man. Not sure which bits work and which don't :-)
