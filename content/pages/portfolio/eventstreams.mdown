# Eventstreams

![Alt text](/attachments/eventstreams.jpg "The Eventstreams logo")

Originally devised by [Matt Jukes](http://digitalbydefault.com/) I developed this web application in my spare time. Built in Ruby on Rails the hosted web service enables a user to sign up and create a website for an event including support for custom domains. Originally devised to support small conferences it has it's roots in the CMS system I built for [WOMAD](http://womad.org) to run their festival website so as such it could easily be re-purposed for music festivals, design events, in fact pretty much anything that has people doing things in spaces at certain times during a specific set of days. The sites it creates can have custom themes which support modern browsers and mobile devices. Although technically a beta product, it's fully working and already used in production for [Intersections 2011](http://intersections2011.com) and Bettr.
