# Rusic

![Alt text](/attachments/rusic.jpg "Rusic website front page")

Working with Simpleweb I designed and coded the initial front end of this idea collation and rating service. Written in Ruby on Rails by the [Simpleweb](http://simpleweb.co.uk/) in house developers I used HAML and SASS to skin the prototype front end and admin area &mdash; all designed "in the browser" and using CSS3 to provide richer styling without having to crack open Photoshop. [Rusic](http://rusic.com/) was rapidly developed and deployed and is has been used by Fat Face to run a "Face of Fat Face" competition using a custom theme designed by designers at Fat Face and implemented by the team at [Simpleweb](http://simpleweb.co.uk/). The site and admin design has now been taken forward from my initial prototype by the in-house Simplweb team.
