# Infocow

[Jiva Technology](http://jivatechnology.com) were approached by [Futurelab](http://futurelab.org.uk) to design and build this social network site for collating useful resources for young people. Using the agile methodology we iterated through several versions, improving both the UX and the design / look & feel of the system based on feedback from stakeholders and young people.

Several stages of refinement took place, with the final piece of the experience puzzle provided by the rich interactive carousel style navigation at the top of the page.
