Between 2002 and 2009 I worked full time as part of the team at Real World Multimedia. A small team &mdash; only three people &mdash; we were responsible for most of the digital output from Realworld, Realworld Studios, WOMAD and Peter Gabriel including all the web sites, online shops, ticketing systems (for WOMAD Charlton Park), DVDs and the enhanced sections of a few CD releases. Additionally we were creating a lot of the video content used by Realworld Records and Peter Gabriel as part of their marketing.
